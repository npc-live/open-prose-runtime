# How to Build OpenProse

We're going to do this process in a sort of iterative loop where we gradually build out the features and we test along the way as we go.

Note that the high level implementation plan will be:

- build the LLM-as-judge harness and test it on something trivial
- - at this stage you'll make sure we can configure a Claude Code session to:
- - - execute a `claude code -p` command
- - - inspect the jsonl logs
- - - judge the behavior along a test rubric
- build the first feature in the iteration loop
- - - test it with the LLM-as-judge harness
- - - if it passes, move on to the next feature
- - - if it fails, fix the issues and re-test
- rinse and repeat for each feature
- - - Stop after three features so I can inspect/review before we build the rest.

---

## The Iteration Loop

For each language feature, we complete these steps in order:

### Step 1: Parser

Build the parser rules to recognize the syntax for this feature.

- Add grammar rules (likely using a parser generator or hand-written recursive descent)
- Handle indentation-based blocks
- Produce an AST node for this feature
- Write unit tests for the parser
- Write integration tests for the parser (to combine various permutations of the feature being used alongside any previously implemented language features)

### Step 2: Validator

Build validation to catch errors at compile time.

- Semantic validation (e.g., referenced agents exist, skills are imported)
- Type checking where applicable
- Helpful error messages with line numbers
- Write unit tests for the validator
- Write integration tests for the validator (to combine various permutations of the feature being used alongside any previously implemented language features)

### Step 3: Compiler (Expansion)

Build the compiler pass that expands this feature to canonical form.

- Syntax sugar expansion
- Normalization to verbose form for Orchestrator consumption
- Generate the expanded program output
- Write unit tests for the compiler
- Write integration tests for the compiler (to combine various permutations of the feature being used alongside any previously implemented language features)

### Step 4: Interpreter Documentation

Update the OpenProse Skill's interpreter documentation.

- Add execution rules for this feature
- Document how the Orchestrator should handle it
- Note that this should not be overly verbose. One of the whole principles of the language is that it should be self-evident to read.
- Write unit tests for the interpreter documentation
- Write integration tests for the interpreter documentation (to combine various permutations of the feature being used alongside any previously implemented language features)

### Step 5: Syntax Highlighting (LSP Semantic Tokens)

Add semantic token highlighting for this feature via LSP.

- Implement semantic token provider using the parser from Step 1
- Mark tokens with appropriate types (keyword, operator, string, comment, agent-name, skill-name, etc.)
- Reuse parser AST to identify token types accurately
- Keywords, operators, strings, comments, and special syntax (`**...**`)
- Write unit tests for the syntax highlighting
- Write integration tests for the syntax highlighting (to combine various permutations of the feature being used alongside any previously implemented language features)

### Step 6: Plugin Examples

Add example `.prose` files to the plugin that demonstrate this feature.

- Create practical, real-world examples in `plugin/examples/`
- Each example should focus on a common use case (code review, debugging, content creation, etc.)
- Combine the new feature with previously implemented features where appropriate
- Use clear comments explaining each step
- Update `plugin/examples/README.md` with the new examples
- Update `plugin/skills/open-prose/SKILL.md` if the examples list needs refreshing
- Run `npm test` to verify new examples pass the Example Validation Tests

**Important**: Examples must only use implemented syntax. Future/planned syntax examples go in `plugin/examples/roadmap/`.

**Automatic testing**: All files in `plugin/examples/` are automatically tested by `examples.test.ts` to ensure they parse and compile correctly. See "Plugin Examples Validation Tests" in the Classical Unit Tests section.

### Step 7: E2E Test (LLM-as-Judge)

Run the feature through the test harness with an LLM judge.

- Create a test program exercising this feature
- Run in Claude Code. OpenCode will be supported later.
- Judge evaluates Orchestrator behavior
- If pass → proceed to next feature
- If fail → fix issues and re-test

## Feature Implementation Checklist

When adding or modifying a language feature, these are the files that typically need to be updated. Use this as a checklist to ensure nothing is missed.

### Core Language (in order of implementation)

| Step | Files | What to Do |
|------|-------|------------|
| **1. Tokens** | `plugin/src/parser/tokens.ts` | Add new `TokenType` enum values for keywords/operators |
| **2. Lexer** | `plugin/src/parser/lexer.ts` | Add lexing rules to recognize new tokens |
| **3. AST** | `plugin/src/parser/ast.ts` | Define new AST node interfaces (e.g., `AgentDefinitionNode`) |
| **4. Parser** | `plugin/src/parser/parser.ts` | Add parsing rules to build AST nodes from tokens |
| **5. Validator** | `plugin/src/validator/validator.ts` | Add semantic validation (references exist, types match, etc.) |
| **6. Compiler** | `plugin/src/compiler/compiler.ts` | Add compilation/expansion logic for the feature |
| **7. LSP** | `plugin/src/lsp/semantic-tokens.ts` | Add syntax highlighting token mappings |

### Exports (if adding new types)

| File | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| `plugin/src/parser/index.ts` | Export new AST types (use `export type` for interfaces) |
| `plugin/src/index.ts` | Re-export if needed at top level |

### Tests

| File | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| `plugin/src/__tests__/<feature>.test.ts` | Create unit tests covering lexer, parser, validator, compiler, LSP |
| `plugin/src/__tests__/examples.test.ts` | No changes needed (auto-discovers examples) |

### Documentation

| File | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| `plugin/skills/open-prose/prose.md` | Update DSL reference with new syntax |
| `plugin/skills/open-prose/SKILL.md` | Update if execution behavior changes |

### Examples

| Location | What to Do |
|----------|------------|
| `plugin/examples/` | Add practical example `.prose` files using the feature |
| `plugin/examples/README.md` | Document new examples |
| `plugin/examples/roadmap/` | Move any "future syntax" examples here if not yet implemented |

### E2E Tests

| Location | What to Do |
|----------|------------|
| `test-harness/test-programs/` | Add `tier-XX-<feature>.prose` test program |

### Verification Commands

After implementation, run these to verify everything works:

```bash
# From plugin/
npm test                    # Run all 177+ unit tests
npm run lint                # Type check

# From test-harness/
npx ts-node index.ts --all  # Run all E2E tests
```

### Common Gotchas

1. **Bun type exports**: Use `export type { Interface }` not `export { Interface }` in barrel files
2. **Test count**: Update README.md if test count changes significantly
3. **Examples**: Only use implemented syntax in `plugin/examples/`; future syntax goes in `roadmap/`

## LLM-as-Judge Framework

We need to build a test harness that allows us to run an OpenProse program in Claude Code, while we have an LLM-as-judge system (use `claude code -p` with instructions to observe the behavior and the jsonl logs, etc (see `/Users/sl/code/stack/archive/docs-claude-code` and `~/.claude/` directory for outputs)), and judge how well the Orchestrator Session handled that feature according to a rubric we will define. OpenCode will be supported later.

### Test Harness Components

```
test-harness/
├── runner.ts              # Executes .prose programs via claude code -p
├── log-collector.ts       # Collects jsonl logs from ~/.claude/
├── judge.ts               # Invokes LLM judge with logs + rubric
├── rubric.md              # Evaluation criteria
├── test-programs/         # .prose files for each feature

│   ├── tier-01-simple-session.prose
│   └── ...
└── reports/               # Judge output for each run
```

### The Rubric

Rate the Orchestrator on a Scale of 1 to 5 for each criterion:

| Criterion                 | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control Flow Accuracy** | Did it accurately follow the program's control flow structure?                                                               |
| **Clarity of Execution**  | Did it ever appear confused or lost about what to do next?                                                                   |
| **Intelligent Judgment**  | Did it make good judgment calls when asked to use its own intelligence to handle context passing, condition evaluation, etc? |
| **Feature Handling**      | Did it accurately handle Feature X (the one we just added) according to the specification?                                   |
| **State Management**      | Did it accurately manage state or lose state at any point?                                                                   |
| **Task Completion**       | Was the system as a whole successful in completing the program's intended task?                                              |
| **Compile Phase**         | Did the compile phase work accurately as expected?                                                                           |
| **Bootup Smoothness**     | Did bootup time go smoothly without errors or confusion?                                                                     |

**Passing threshold:** Average score ≥ 4.0, with no individual criterion below 3.

## Combinatorial Testing

As more language features are added, we want to add tests that test various permutations of the features being used together.

### Combination Test Matrix (Examples)

| Test | Features Combined                | Program                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| C1   | parallel + named blocks          | `combo-parallel-blocks.prose`       |
| C2   | loop until + parallel            | `combo-loop-parallel.prose`         |
| C3   | try/catch + loop                 | `combo-try-loop.prose`              |
| C4   | pipeline + block params          | `combo-pipeline-params.prose`       |
| C5   | nested parallel + error handling | `combo-nested-parallel-error.prose` |
| C6   | Full kitchen sink                | `combo-kitchen-sink.prose`          |

## Classical Unit Tests

For deterministic components, we add classical unit tests:

### Parser Tests

- Valid syntax → correct AST
- Invalid syntax → helpful error message
- Edge cases (empty blocks, deeply nested, etc.)

### Validator Tests

- Undefined agent reference → error
- Undefined skill reference → error
- Duplicate agent names → error
- Valid program → no errors

### Compiler Tests

- Syntax sugar expansion correct
- Canonical form generation correct
- Import resolution correct

### LSP Semantic Tokens Tests

- All keywords highlighted correctly
- Strings vs identifiers distinguished
- Comments grayed out
- Agent names, skill names, and variables highlighted semantically
- Special syntax (`**...**`) highlighted correctly
- Nested structures handled

### Plugin Examples Validation Tests

The `plugin/examples/` directory contains user-facing example `.prose` files. These are automatically tested to ensure they remain valid as the language evolves.

**Test file:** `plugin/src/__tests__/examples.test.ts`

**What it does:**
- Dynamically loads all `.prose` files from `plugin/examples/` (excludes `roadmap/`)
- For each file, asserts it parses without errors
- For each file, asserts it compiles without errors
- Optionally uses Jest snapshots to detect compiled output regressions

**Why this matters:**
- Catches regressions when parser/compiler changes
- Ensures shipped examples always work
- No duplication - examples serve double duty as tests
- Automatically picks up new examples added in Step 6

**What it does NOT test:**
- Execution semantics (that's what LLM-as-judge E2E tests are for)
- Edge cases and error conditions (that's what unit tests with inline strings are for)

---

## Success Criteria

The language is complete when:

1. ✅ All Tier 0-13 features implemented
2. ✅ All tier test programs pass LLM-as-judge (≥4.0 average)
3. ✅ All combinatorial tests pass
4. ✅ Classical unit tests have >90% coverage
5. ✅ Works on Claude Code. OpenCode will be supported later.
6. ✅ LSP semantic tokens provide accurate syntax highlighting in VS Code
7. ✅ CLI is polished and documented
8. ✅ Example programs demonstrate real-world usage
9. ✅ All plugin examples pass validation tests (parse + compile)
